**Introduction:**
This is a chrome extension which can open links on a page in a small popup window on the same page. 
Just hover and link and then hover over the small bubble appearing next to that link and Voila ðŸŽ‰ 
You are viewing what is inside that link without clicking it.

This feature comes very handy when you are searching for something on the web. This is the successor of my previous chrome extension Popup Open.

## Previous Version - Extension-Popup-Open
**Introduction:**
This is a chrome extension which opens Google search links in popup view in the same tab.

No hassle of clicking on links, opening them and then going back if it does not meet your needs. Presenting Popup Open, the very first extension of its kind which opens google search links in a popup view on the same tab, thus helping you save time and efforts. Just hover over the search links and check what is there inside!
